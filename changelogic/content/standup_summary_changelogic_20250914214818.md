**Standup Summary:**  
The code aims to retrieve recent commits from a GitHub branch (e.g., `testbranch`) within the last 24 hours and display file changes, additions, deletions, and commit messages. Key points:  

1. **Objective**: Fetch and analyze commits on a specific branch (e.g., `testbranch`) for repository updates.  
2. **Implementation**:  
   - Uses `go-github` to interact with the GitHub API.  
   - Filters commits within the last 24 hours using `Since` parameter.  
   - Displays commit details (SHA, author, date, message, and file changes).  
3. **Output Highlights**:  
   - Multiple commits are shown, including:  
     - 103 files changed in `go.mod` (e.g., new dependencies).  
     - 93 additions/deletions in `main.go`.  
     - Commit details like `Additions: 4`, `Deletions: 0`, and `Changes: 4` for `go.mod`.  
   - Errors or issues noted in the code (e.g., potential API call failures, incomplete output).  
4. **Next Steps**:  
   - Fix the branch retrieval logic (e.g., ensure `testbranch.GetName()` is correctly handled).  
   - Debug commit details to ensure accurate file changes and metadata are displayed.  

**Notes**:  
- The code includes a placeholder function (`Last24HourChangesOnBranch`) that needs implementation.  
- The output shows progress, but errors (e.g., API call failures) may occur if the branch or repository is not properly configured.
