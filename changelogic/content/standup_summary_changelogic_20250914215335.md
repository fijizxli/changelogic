**Standup Summary:**

1. **Documentation Update**:  
   - Added "Changelogic - Proof of Concept" title and adjusted description in `README.md` (Additions: 1, Deletions: 2).  

2. **Time Frame Adjustment**:  
   - Updated commit time window to **last 24 hours** instead of 80 hours (3 days) in the codebase.  
   - Fixed logic for handling commits and improving performance in the loop.  

3. **Code Improvements**:  
   - Refactored `GetCommitDetails` to handle commit details correctly, ensuring proper retrieval of file diffs and stats.  
   - Simplified the main loop to focus on relevant commits (e.g., `testbranch` for testing).  

4. **Testing & Validation**:  
   - Verified that the application now accurately tracks commits from GitHub, with improved error handling for edge cases (e.g., invalid SHA or missing files).  

**Key Takeaways**:  
- The project is stable, with focus on refining time windows and improving commit detail retrieval.  
- Documentation was updated to reflect changes in the codebase.  
- Testing confirmed that the application works within the intended time frame and handles edge cases effectively.
