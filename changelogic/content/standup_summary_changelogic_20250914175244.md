### Standup Summary  
**Objective:** Retrieve repository metadata (repos, branches, commits) using `go-github` package.  

#### **Key Highlights:**  
1. **Functionality Achieved:**  
   - Listed user repositories (`RepoService.ListByUser`).  
   - Retrieved branches and their names for a specific repo.  
   - Fetched commits from a branch with file change details (e.g., `go.mod`, `main.go` diffs).  

2. **Challenges & Issues:**  
   - **Version Compatibility:** Code uses `github.com/google/go-github/v74` but shows "experiments with go-github package" and errors related to `go.sum`/`go.mod` changes, suggesting potential version conflicts or incomplete dependencies.  
   - **Incomplete Functionality:** The `Last24HourChangesOnBranch` function is stubbed and not fully implemented (e.g., commit details parsing).  

3. **Next Steps:**  
   - **Resolve Dependencies:** Ensure `go-github` version compatibility with `go.sum`/`go.mod`.  
   - **Implement Commit Details:** Complete the logic to parse commit diffs (e.g., `commit.Files`) and display changes accurately.  
   - **Test Edge Cases:** Verify behavior with different GitHub versions and repository structures.  

#### **Observations:**  
- The code works for basic repo/branch/commit retrieval but faces hurdles with dependency management and incomplete functionality.  
- Future improvements should focus on stabilizing dependencies and fully implementing commit detail parsing.
