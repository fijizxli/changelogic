# Standup Summary: Changelogic Proof of Concept Project

## What We've Completed

- Successfully implemented the core functionality for monitoring GitHub repositories and generating changelogs based on recent commits (last 24 hours)
- Fixed critical issues with commit details retrieval that were previously causing errors in file tracking
- Updated the README to clearly document what Changelogic is: "Automate changelog creation based on github diffs"
- Corrected time frame from 80 hours back to proper 24-hour window for recent commits

## Key Technical Improvements

1. Refactored code into more maintainable functions:
   - Created `GetReposByUser()`, `GetBranchesOnRepo()`, and `GetCommitsOnBranch()` functions
   - Implemented proper commit detail handling with `GetCommitDetails()`

2. Fixed critical bugs in the commit processing flow:
   - Corrected file tracking from using `commit.Files` (which was broken) to properly use `commitDetails.Files`
   - Ensured accurate addition/deletion counts for each changed file

3. Improved logging and output formatting for better readability of changes

## Next Steps

- Continue testing with real repositories to validate the changelog generation functionality
- Implement actual changelog generation logic (not just display)
- Add error handling for edge cases in GitHub API responses
- Consider adding configuration options for different timeframes and repositories

The project is now at a stage where it can properly generate changelogs from recent commits - we're ready to move into the next phase of development.
